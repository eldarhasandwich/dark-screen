# Dark Screen

I have a second monitor that is useless and super bright while I am playing games, but the atrocious windows display switching means its more hassle than it is worth to turn this monitor off. I have resorted to just fullscreening https://blackscreen.app/ in the past but why not display some useful bits and bobs and idk have some cool PS5-style animated background or something.
